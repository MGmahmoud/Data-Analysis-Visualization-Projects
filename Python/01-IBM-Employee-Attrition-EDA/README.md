# **IBM Employee Attrition Analysis**

This project explores the **IBM Employee Attrition Dataset**, aiming to uncover patterns and insights related to employee attrition using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and machine learning techniques. The notebook walks through a comprehensive data analysis pipeline, demonstrating critical steps in understanding, visualizing, and modeling the dataset.

---

### **Project Overview**

Employee attrition is a significant challenge for organizations as it impacts productivity and incurs recruitment costs. This analysis helps identify the factors contributing to attrition, enabling organizations to take proactive measures to improve employee retention.

### **Key Steps in the Analysis**

1. **Introduction and Data Overview**
   - Brief explanation of the dataset and its relevance to business.
   - Initial inspection of the dataset, including data types and missing values.

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Removal of irrelevant columns (e.g., `EmployeeCount`, `Over18`).
   - Handling single-value columns and encoding categorical features.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizations to examine the distribution of categorical and numerical variables.
   - Heatmap of correlations among numerical features.
   - Insights into attrition trends based on marital status, job role, and other features.

4. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Splitting data into training and testing sets.
   - Feature engineering for model readiness.

5. **Machine Learning Models**
   - Implementation of a **Logistic Regression** model to predict attrition.
   - Evaluation of the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
   - Comparison with an additional model (e.g., Random Forest) for improved performance.

6. **Key Findings**
   - Highlights of the most influential factors contributing to employee attrition.
   - Recommendations for organizational strategies based on insights.
