# Customer Churn Dashboard (Power BI Project)

## 📊 Overview  
This **Customer Churn Dashboard** project showcases my ability to conduct **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and build insightful, interactive dashboards using **Power BI**.  
The goal was to uncover the **factors influencing customer churn** and provide actionable business recommendations, with clean visuals and advanced **DAX calculations**.

## 🔍 My Process: How I Tackled the Churn Case Study

### 1️⃣ Business Requirements  
- **Goal:** Understand what drives customer churn and how to reduce it.  
- **Data Source:** Provided churn dataset simulating real-world telecom data.  
- **Main Questions:**
  - Who are the customers that churn?
  - What services are they using?
  - What patterns can predict churn?

### 2️⃣ Data Investigation & Cleaning  
- Conducted **EDA across data categories**: demographics, contracts, services, billing.
- Identified **null values**, standardized formats, and verified data consistency.

  - Business Overview
  - Key Requirements  
  - User Stories & Success Criteria  
- Summarized insights needed and visuals planned.

### 4️⃣ Dashboard Design & Color Scheme  
- Selected a clear, accessible **color palette**.
  - Dual tones for binary charts (e.g., Churned vs Retained)
  - Distinct tones for multi-category charts (e.g., churn reasons, payment types)

| Customers aged 60+ churn more | Investigate service suitability or age-related factors |
| Monthly contracts = high churn | Promote yearly plans with benefits |
| Paper check users churn more | Encourage digital payment methods |
| Unlimited plans + low usage churn | Consider targeted usage-based pricing |
| Low service call states = high churn | Evaluate customer engagement levels |
