## 🎯 Key Findings & Recommendations

| Finding | Recommendation |
|--------|----------------|
| High churn from "competitor offers" | Benchmark and enhance offers |
| Customers aged 60+ churn more | Investigate service suitability or age-related factors |
| Monthly contracts = high churn | Promote yearly plans with benefits |
| Paper check users churn more | Encourage digital payment methods |
| Unlimited plans + low usage churn | Consider targeted usage-based pricing |
| Low service call states = high churn | Evaluate customer engagement levels |
